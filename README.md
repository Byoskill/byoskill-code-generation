CLI Tool to write code generation project using a model.

This tool is an NPM module that bundles a set of libraries and scripts to allow a RAPID developer to generate easily code ( source files, AST, assets etc) from a JSON model.

## How to use

## Concepts

The JSON model structure is loosely defined to allow any model to be accepted.

A generation project has to be provided to the tool. This project will perform the code generation orchestrated by the present library.
